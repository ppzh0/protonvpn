                <h2>Why this exist</h2>
                <p>
                    As of 2025, <strong>wars</strong>, <strong>coups</strong>, and <strong>internet restrictions</strong> are growing around the world, especially in countries with <em>political instability</em>. Governments are increasingly shutting down the internet or blocking websites to control the flow of information and stop protests. In countries like <strong>Iran</strong>, <strong>Myanmar</strong>, and <strong>China</strong>, it’s becoming harder for people to <em>communicate or organize online</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                     To bypass these restrictions, many people turn to <em>VPNs</em>, which help them access blocked content and protect their privacy. However, governments are cracking down <em>on VPN use</em>, making it more difficult for citizens to <em>stay connected or share information freely</em>. ProtonVPN stands out for its strong commitment to <strong>user privacy</strong>, which is a key reason it is featured on this website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Its encryption protocols and <strong>strict no-logs policy</strong> ensure that users' online activities are kept secure and anonymous, making it <em>an ideal choice for activists, journalists, and individuals seeking to protect their digital footprint</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ProtonVPN's transparency and dedication to safeguarding user data have earned it a trusted reputation among those who prioritize privacy, especially in regions with <strong>oppressive surveillance</strong> or <strong>censorship</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This focus on security, combined with its <em>open-source software and transparency reports</em>, reinforces ProtonVPN’s position as a top choice for those needing a reliable and <em> privacy-conscious VPN service </em>.
